Emualtor Selector:

user defined emulator display to have everything lauchable in one location.

how it works:
allows the user to select a file loction with predefined emualtor eg: xemu
the program will add it to the list
if the program has a manual update ask for the link or if not
currently it will only be designed for one entry but i want the ability like with xenia to have multiple intencies.
the emulator will have a launch button that opens that one. further down the line it might be possible to have game lauchers but idk i need to look into emulators to see if its possible

any bugs please create an issue and explain the steps of repeat and version number.
if you have any suggestions tag it with the suggestion tag.
